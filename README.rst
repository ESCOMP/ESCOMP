 The Earth System Community Modeling Portal (ESCOMP)

This repository provides information about the ESCOMP github
organization:

Management
==========

The ESCOMP github organization is managed by the University Corporation
for Atmospheric Research (https://www2.ucar.edu/).

Policies for inclusion of a repository in this organization
===========================================================

The ESCOMP github organization is for large, community-oriented earth
system modeling projects of broad interest.

Projects stored here meet all of the following criteria:

* They are related to earth system modeling in some way

* They are supported (e.g., if someone files an issue, it will be seen
  and addressed in some way)

* They are not just internal NCAR projects, but rather have some
  involvement (typically strong involvement) from outside communities
  (e.g., the university community or other agencies)

* This is the primary repository for this project, not a fork of a
  primary repository that is stored elsewhere. For example, this would
  not generally be an appropriate place to store the CESM-specific fork
  of a project whose primary repository is stored in a different github
  organization. One exception would be if the primary repository is a
  fairly closed operation, and we maintain the main community-oriented
  fork of the project. The rationale is:

  * We want ESCOMP to contain a relatively small number of
    repositories. Opening the door to storing forks here could greatly
    increase the number of repositories in this organization, which will
    make it hard to find what you're looking for.

  * ESCOMP is not CESM-centric, or even NCAR-centric. Thus, it doesn't
    make sense to store the fork of another model here just because this
    is the fork that happens to be used in CESM or by NCAR scientists.

  * Inclusion in ESCOMP implies that this is the repository with which
    other communities (the university community, scientists from other
    agencies, etc.) should interact. This is typically not the case for
    forks.
